# Milestone 1 - Guest Experience Personalization

## Data Preparation
We structured the dataset to ensure proper training and evaluation:
- **Historical Data**: Used to analyze past guest interactions.
- **Training Data**: Includes interactions before a set cut-off date for model learning.
- **Testing Data**: Contains interactions after the cut-off to evaluate model performance.

This method ensures our model is trained on past trends and tested on future unseen data.

## Feature Engineering
We derived key features to enhance predictions, including:
- **Guest-Level Features:**
  - Total visits per guest
  - Average spending per visit
  - Preferred services and amenities
- **Behavioral Features:**
  - Frequency of specific service usage
  - Common booking times
  - Average length of stay
- **Additional Contextual Features:**
  - Seasonal preferences
  - Booking lead time
  - Special requests history

## Data Integration
We integrated the processed data into a structured format and removed potential data leakage sources, such as:
- Guest ID
- Booking timestamps
- Direct revenue-impacting factors (to ensure unbiased predictions)

## Encoding Categorical Data
We applied:
- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables like preferred room type.
- **Label Encoding** for the target variable to transform it into a numerical format.

## Model Training
The project employs advanced machine learning techniques to personalize guest experiences. We explored models including:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- Neural Networks for deep feature learning

## Model Evaluation
The model was assessed using:
- **Accuracy & Precision**: To measure predictive success.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: To understand key factors influencing recommendations.
- **User Feedback Integration**: To refine personalization strategies.

## Conclusion
This milestone established a foundation for guest experience personalization through data-driven insights. Future work includes refining features, improving model accuracy, and incorporating real-time adjustments for dynamic personalization.
