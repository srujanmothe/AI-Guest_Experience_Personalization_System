# AI-Powered Guest Experience Personalization System for Hospitality

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing guest experiences in the hospitality industry using AI-driven personalization. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA, the system analyzes guest feedback, monitors sentiment trends, and provides personalized recommendations for dining, activities, and amenities. Additionally, real-time alerts help service teams proactively address guest concerns and optimize service delivery.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for dining, activities, and amenities based on guest behavior.
- **Sentiment Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of guest feedback for proactive service improvements.
- **Automated Staff Alerts**: Instant notifications for staff to address guest concerns.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visual insights into hotel bookings, customer preferences, and review sentiments.

## Repository Structure
The project is divided into four milestones, each contributing to the development of the guest experience system.
